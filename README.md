# feed

![Publish Docker image](https://github.com/abatilo/feed/workflows/Publish%20Docker%20image/badge.svg)

My own personally aggregated feed of things on the internet to read. I do too
much work checking multiple different lists of things, so I just wanted to make
my own personal page that I can control entirely on my own.

## Things to do

- [ ] Read from HackerNews
- [ ] Have some kind of persistence layer to keep track of what I've already added to the queue
